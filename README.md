Kitesurfing App for Android
===========================

The app implements succesfully the following features:
* Handles network-calls to different API endpoints
* Handles network-call errors and parses JSON files accordingly
* Activities handle screen rotations and configuration changes and preserve information between these
* Layout is scalable and adaptable to different screen sizes and densities
* Interface is highly intuitive and provides the user with meaningful screen messages
* Interface does not freeze as network operations are handled on a background thread
